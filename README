Runless BASIC
=============

About
-----

This is a free software project to develop a BASIC programming environment with a graphical IDE.

Unlike similar projects, Runless will produce native executables _without_ it's own runtime library, or with minimal such dependencies.

The compiler will be written to use a macro system to produce code that links against native APIs directly whenever possible.


Motivation
----------

*	Personally I enjoy compiler development.
*	I like the BASIC language.
*	There is no good, easy-to-use alternative to Cocoa development on Mac.

	Yes, I know about [REALstudio], [LiveCode], [Gambas], [PureBASIC] and the like, but each of these have significant flaws in my opinion.
